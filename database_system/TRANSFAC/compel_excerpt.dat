CC  Functional interaction between ubiquitous factor USF2a, which appears to be
CC  the predominant bHLH/ZIP factor in liver nuclear extract, and
CC  RXRalpha:T3Rbeta heterodimers bound to overlapping site enhances
CC  transcription in response to thyroid hormone. USF site is located within
CC  DR1, a binding site for T3R:RXR heterodimers.

CC  The transcription factors HNF-6 and C/EBP beta are coexpressed in the
CC  mesenchyme of trachea and in the proximal airways of 15.5 and 18.5 dpc
CC  mouse embryos. Cooperation between these two factors is essential for
CC  tissue-specific regulation of Foxf1a gene in gut-derived organs of
CC  developing mice.
